HOW TO USE

1) Download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it somewhere.
2) Open Forge's "res" folder. It should be in the folder your EXE file is in.
3) Open the extracted repository.
4) Open the folder of the set you want to import.
5) Create a folder of that set in the "res/cardsfolder" folder, for example "SVG".
6) Move all cards from the repository's "Cards (.txt)" folder to the folder you just made.
7) Move all cards from the repository's "Tokens (.txt)" folder to "res/tokenscripts".
8) Do the above for all the sets you want to import. (Starting with 4. You don't need to redownload the whole thing.)

QUESTIONS THAT WILL LIKELY BE ASKED

Q: A card made Forge crash! What should I do?
A: Made sure you put the token scripts in the right place. If the card doesn't use tokens, however...

Q: ...Then?
A: You can create an issue on the repository's Git page. I will try to fix that as soon as possible.

Q: A card doesn't work properly, what should I do?
A: Same as above, create an issue for it and I'll take a look when I can.

Q: The cards work, but the images aren't here. Where can I get them?
A: To reduce the size of the file you need to download, images were removed from the repository. You can use Cajun's forgeLoad in the link below to download them — follow the instructions there. If you're using mobile, you probably aren't going to ask this question.

Q: I downloaded the cards, but for some of them the pictures aren't loading. Why?
A: Some cardnames coincide with the canon ones and therefore had to have an asterisk appended at the end. Check if it's one of the cards — Dark Bargain will probably be the one you're looking for :P — and change its filename from "CARDNAME.full.jpg" to "CARDNAME*.full.jpg".
